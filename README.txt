Description:

In this program, I practiced working with “class” by implementing Yahtzee. Yahtzee is a dice and board game played with two players but here I only implement it for a solo player I did not implement yahtzee bonus

The rules of the game can be found at https://cardgames.io/yahtzee/.

Playing the game:

The user rolls the dice three times. The first time the user rolls all 5 dice.
Then the user is prompted to keep any dice that they want and roll the rest. 
Once the user completes all of their rolls, then they are prompted to select one of the board rows. They will have the option to play any row, but would get points by playing one of “Three of a kind”, “Chance”, or “Fives”. 

The user continues playing until they play all rows. They cannot play a row twice, but they can play any row that has not been played yet.
